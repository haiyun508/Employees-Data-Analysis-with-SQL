# Summary
Data used in this project is six CSV files regarding employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. 
First, an ERD of the tables were sketched. Second, I create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Third, each CSV file is imported into the corresponding SQL table. Third, sql queries were made to do some data Analysis.
